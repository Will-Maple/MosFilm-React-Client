# MosFilm-Client
 This is project to learn React as part of Career Foundry's Full-Stack Immersion Course. It is built on or using
 {
  React.jsx
  Parcel
  SCSS
 }
Currently it just opens to an index page, the framework is being built to connect to my MosFilm API (https://github.com/Will-Maple/movie_api).

You can find me on Github (https://github.com/Will-Maple) and this project's repository (https://github.com/Will-Maple/MosFilm-Client).
